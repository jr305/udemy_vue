This repo is following along with the following course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/

I am using this repo to learn about the technology and evaluate the fesability of introducing this to my current jobs MVC application. That application has views that heavily make use of MVC razor views. Other newer pages use Knockout Js for there templating. But there is also plenty of libraries that I would prefer we no longer use. 

Things that I will be focusing on during this course:
-What level of effort is required from a developer in the company to understand Vue even in a basic level to be able to maintain components developed by what I hope becomes the core UI team?

-What compatibility issues can we expect if we introduce this library? For example, there is some syntax that would be better to avoid if we use .cshtml files for the mark up like the '@' shorthand in vue

-How difficult would it be to migrate existing controls designed for Knockout js or html helpers for controls designed for MVC razor?
